Video :
    added at the end 
    It shows the code and how I have ran it with different examples
    
Explanation for the code :
    I have created a class Recommender which contains various functions:
    - def LoadData which loads the data from the csv file 
    - def BuildVector which builds the TfIDfVectorizer
    - def getRecommendation finds the similarity between the data and user input and returns the data that are similar
